  text: "The water in dome 2 has changed colour, we\u2019re trying to work out what\u2019s
    causing it. I think it's because this brighter lighting is causing more dark algae
    blooms, but they\u2019re not letting any unauthorised scientists in to investigate.
    I\u2019ve heard rumours that the mushroom samples in there have been growing at
    a rapid rate; I wonder if it\u2019s got something to do with the water... "
